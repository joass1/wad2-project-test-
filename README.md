   - Displays the homepage with navigation options.

2. **Search Feature**  
   <img src="screenshots/search.png" width="600">  
   - Users can browse and filter items by criteria.

3. **User Dashboard**  
   <img src="screenshots/dashboard.png" width="600">

## Developers Setup Guide

Comprehensive steps to help other developers or evaluators run and test your project.

---

### 0) Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.4+  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ and npm v9+  
- Access to backend or cloud services used (Firebase, MongoDB Atlas, AWS S3, etc.)

---

### 1) Download the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org-or-user>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
npm install
```

---

### 2) Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=<your_backend_or_firebase_url>
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your_firebase_api_key>
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your_auth_domain>
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<your_storage_bucket>
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<your_sender_id>
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your_app_id>
```

> Never commit the `.env` file to your repository.  
> Instead, include a `.env.example` file with placeholder values.

---

### 3) Backend / Cloud Service Setup

#### Firebase
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the following:
   - **Authentication** → Email/Password sign-in
   - **Firestore Database** or **Realtime Database**
   - **Hosting (optional)** if you plan to deploy your web app
4. Copy the Firebase configuration into your `.env` file.

#### Optional: Express.js / MongoDB
If your app includes a backend:
1. Create a `/server` folder for backend code.
2. Inside `/server`, create a `.env` file with:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   ```
3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

---

### 4) Run the Frontend
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The project will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

To build and preview the production version:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

### 5) Testing the Application

#### Manual Testing
Perform the following checks before submission:

| Area | Test Description | Expected Outcome |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Authentication | Register, Login, Logout | User successfully signs in/out |
| CRUD Operations | Add, Edit, Delete data | Database updates correctly |
| Responsiveness | Test on mobile & desktop | Layout adjusts without distortion |
| Navigation | All menu links functional | Pages route correctly |
| Error Handling | Invalid inputs or missing data | User-friendly error messages displayed |

#### Automated Testing (Optional)
If applicable:
```bash
npm run test
```

---

### 6) Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `Module not found` | Missing dependencies | Run `npm install` again |
| `Firebase: permission-denied` | Firestore security rules not set | Check rules under Firestore → Rules |
| `CORS policy error` | Backend not allowing requests | Enable your domain in CORS settings |
| `.env` variables undefined | Missing `VITE_` prefix | Rename variables to start with `VITE_` |
| `npm run dev` fails | Node version mismatch | Check Node version (`node -v` ≥ 18) |

## Group Reflection

Each member should contribute 2–3 sentences on their learning and project experience.

> **Example Template:**  
> - *Alice:* Learned to build reusable Vue components and manage state effectively.  
> - *Ben:* Gained experience connecting frontend and backend APIs.  
> - *Chloe:* Improved UI/UX design workflow and collaboration using Figma.  
> - *David:* Understood how Firebase Authentication and Firestore integrate with modern SPAs.  

As a team, reflect on:
- Key takeaways from working with real-world frameworks  
- Challenges faced and how they were resolved  
- Insights on teamwork, project management, and problem-solving
